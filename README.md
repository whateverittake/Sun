# Sun
 This repository is a test assignment for applying for the position of Unity Programmer at VRILLAR VIETNAM company.

Program Startup:
Launch the Sun.exe file located in the "build" directory to start the program.

Usage:

Input the values in the corresponding input fields (latitude and longitude values are in degrees).
Click the "Calculate" button to compute the sun's position (Altitude and Azimuth values) as well as shadow casting.

Note:

Latitude values range from -90° (South Pole) to +90° (North Pole).
Longitude values range from -180° (west) to +180° (east).
Altitude represents the angle of the sun above the horizon (0° at the horizon, 90° directly overhead).
Azimuth is the angle between the sun and a reference direction, usually north (0° = North, 90° = East, 180° = South, 270° = West).
The program calculates shadow casting based on sun's position and objects' geometries.

Example:

Important:

Make sure to input correct values for latitude and longitude to get accurate results.
The program provides a visual understanding of sun position and shadow casting based on input data.
